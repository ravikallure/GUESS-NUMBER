# GUESS-NUMBER
This is a simple Python number guessing game where the player selects a difficulty level and tries to guess a randomly chosen number within limited chances.

How it works:
1.Select Difficulty Level
The player chooses between:
Easy â†’ number between 1 and 30
Medium â†’ number between 1 and 60
Hard â†’ number between 1 and 100
Based on the choice, the game randomly picks a secret number within that range.

2.Guessing the Number
The player has 4 chances to guess the secret number.
For each guess:
If the guess is correct â†’ You win! ðŸŽ‰
If the guess is very close (within 5 of the secret number) â†’ "It's very close!"
If the guess is wrong, the game gives a hint whether the guess is too high or too low.

3.Game End
If the player guesses the number correctly within the chances â†’ they win.
If they run out of chances â†’ the game reveals the correct number.

4.Replay Option
After the game ends, the player can choose to play again or exit.
